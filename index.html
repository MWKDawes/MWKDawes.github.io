                        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
                        <h3>I have always been about following my passions, I have always been a creative person and quick learner, and I have always had 
                        an interest in coding. For the majority of my working career I have worked as a Licensed Veterinary Technician, a career that fulfilled 
                        my desire to learn and passion to help animals, but I always knew it was not a long term profession. Around the beginning of the pandemic, I began taking 
                        various online classes to help me satisfy my craving to learn what makes a computer tick. Since then, I've completed Stanford's Code In Place course and multiple 
                        classes through coursera and Udemy covering Python, C# use for gaming, and Javascript. It wasn't until last year that I decided to finally make the leap and 
                        change careers to something that I can see myself doing for the rest of my life. I began discussing with friends and family about the doors that learning coding 
                        can open for you and discovered UI/UX Design, something that stood out to my creative and artistic side. It was then I began working as an LVT part time and 
                        competed a boot camp through The Tech Academy, where I learned the ins and outs of wireframing, design principles, prototyping, etc. I was previously one of the 
                        website managers of The Niles Dog Show, which helped boost my skills in Github and managing shared code. I am eager to join in on your next project and help 
                        bring your ideas to life!</h3>
